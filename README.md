**The application is build using python modules such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and its run using Streamlit**

In the era of digital communication, messaging applications like WhatsApp serve as primary means of staying connected with friends, family, and colleagues. WhatsApp, being one of the most widely used messaging apps globally, generates vast amounts of textual data in the form of chat conversations. Analyzing this data can provide valuable insights into communication patterns, social dynamics, and much more.

**Problem statement**

Analyzing WhatsApp chat data can be a time-consuming task, especially for large groups or long conversations. There is a need for a tool that can quickly and accurately analyze WhatsApp chat data to provide insights into the conversation’s topics being discussed. The tool should also provide visualizations to help users better understand the data and draw conclusions about the conversation’s underlying meaning. The solution should be easy to use, accessible and scalable to handle large amounts of data. 
**Python **
It is a general-purpose programming language.
It provides different types of libraries which provides different functionality to project.
Python is used for predictions and pattern using test and data.
Python consist many libraries which provide mathematical, statistical functions and help to find insights from data.

**Pandas**

This is an open-source Python libraries which is mainly used in Data Science and machine learning subjects.

This library provides analysis tool for data manipulation, using its data structures this are used for analyzing data for manipulating time series analysis and numerical data.


**Numpy**

NumPy stands for Numerical Python.
It is a Python library used for working with arrays.
It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.

**Streamlit**

It's a Python-based library that can turn Python scripts into interactive web apps in minutes.

Streamlit is a free, open-source framework for building and sharing machine learning and data science web apps.
